# Welcome Back

Welcome Back automatically keeps track of players in your group or raid and informs you about players which you met before since activating this AddOn.

## Main Features

- Every time you engage a boss, it records the pull so that you can look up where
  and when you played with others before.
- Upon group join or a player joins an existing group, this AddOn checks any existing records
  and posts a message in your chat frame if a known player is found.
- All players you met before get their unit tooltip expanded with a history
  of the last 5 instances you played together.
- Hold the Shift key while hovering a unit to see timestamps for the activity records in their tooltips.
- Tooltips are also available on the LFG tool: Check if you played before with a group leader
  (while applying for a group) or any applicants (while forming a group).
- Enables applicants list interactions (show tooltips) while forming a group, where you are not the leader.
